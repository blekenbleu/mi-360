Xbox360 controller emulation for Xiaomi Gamepad, with vibration support.

An application that runs in the tray and expose every Xiaomi Gamepad as a XInput-compatible device that can be used for every game or application that supports Xbox360 pads. Rumble works, too!

## HIDLibrary modifications

This repository contains a custom version of HIDLibrary by Mike O'Brien, with some changes that addresses a common problem.

The first change is the addition of a call to ``NativeMethods.CancelIo()`` in case of a timeout in ``ReadData()``.
Without that, every subsequent call to ReadData after a timeout will result in a timeout. Also, the library crashes when closing the device, making the whole application crash (at a very low level).

The second change consists in avoiding any call to `IsConnected` when reading a HID report. This property forces a re-enumeration of the devices, an activity that is pretty heavy when repeated several times per second.
